  <p>Ireland, also known as the Republic of Ireland, is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, in north-western Europe.<br>
  It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel.<br>
  Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest in the world.<br>
  Geopolitically, the island is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), a sovereign state covering five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.<br>
  As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7 million, with 5.1 million in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain.<br>
  The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland.<br>
  Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature.<br>
  Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages. Today, woodland makes up about 10% of the island, compared with a European average of over 33%, with most of it being non-native conifer plantations.<br>
  The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate, and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe.<br>
  Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.<br>
  Gaelic Ireland had emerged by the 1st century AD. The island was Christianised from the 5th century onwards.<br>
  During this period Ireland was divided into many petty kingships under provincial kingships (Cúige "fifth" of the traditional provinces) vying for dominance and the title of High King of Ireland.<br>
  In the late 8th century to early 11th century AD Viking raids and settlement took place culminating in the Battle of Clontarf on 23 April 1014 which resulted in the ending of Viking power in Ireland.<br>
  Following the 12th century Anglo-Norman invasion, England claimed sovereignty.<br>
  However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th–17th century Tudor conquest, which led to colonisation by settlers from Britain. In the 1690s, a system of Protestant English rule was designed to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters, and was extended during the 18th century.<br>
  With the Acts of Union in 1801, Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom.<br>
  A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island, leading to the creation of the Irish Free State, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades until it declared a republic in 1948 ( Republic of Ireland Act, 1948) and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s.<br>
  This subsided following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.<br>
  In 1973, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, with Northern Ireland as part of it, joined the European Economic Community.<br>
  Following a referendum vote in 2016, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland included, left the European Union (EU) in 2020.<br>
  Northern Ireland was granted a limited special status and allowed to operate within the EU single market for goods without being in the European Union.<br>
  Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of literature. Alongside mainstream Western culture, a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed through Gaelic games, Irish music, Irish language, and Irish dance.<br>
  The island's culture shares many features with that of Great Britain, including the English language, and sports such as association football, rugby, horse racing, golf, and boxing.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>From the Act of Union on 1 January 1801, until 6 December 1922, the island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.<br>
  During the Great Famine, from 1845 to 1849, the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30%.<br>
  One million Irish died of starvation and disease and another 1.5 million emigrated, mostly to the United States.<br>
  This set the pattern of emigration for the century to come, resulting in constant population decline up to the 1960s.<br>
  From 1874, and particularly under Charles Stewart Parnell from 1880, the Irish Parliamentary Party gained prominence.<br>
  This was firstly through, widespread agrarian agitation via the Irish Land League, which won land reforms for tenants in the form of the Irish Land Acts, and secondly through its attempts to achieve Home Rule, via two unsuccessful bills which would have granted Ireland limited national autonomy.<br>
  These led to "grass-roots" control of national affairs, under the Local Government Act 1898, that had been in the hands of landlord-dominated grand juries of the Protestant Ascendancy.<br>
  Home Rule seemed certain when the Parliament Act 1911 abolished the veto of the House of Lords, and John Redmond secured the Third Home Rule Act in 1914.<br>
  However, the Unionist movement had been growing since 1886 among Irish Protestants after the introduction of the first home rule bill, fearing discrimination and loss of economic and social privileges if Irish Catholics achieved real political power.<br>
  In the late 19th and early 20th-century unionism was particularly strong in parts of Ulster, where industrialisation was more common in contrast to the more agrarian rest of the island, and where the Protestant population was more prominent, with a majority in four counties.<br>
  Under the leadership of the Dublin-born Sir Edward Carson of the Irish Unionist Party and the Ulsterman Sir James Craig of the Ulster Unionist Party, unionists became strongly militant, forming Ulster Volunteers in order to oppose "the Coercion of Ulster".<br>
  After the Home Rule Bill passed parliament in May 1914, to avoid rebellion with Ulster, the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith introduced an Amending Bill reluctantly conceded to by the Irish Party leadership.<br>
  This provided for the temporary exclusion of Ulster from the workings of the bill for a trial period of six years, with an as yet undecided new set of measures to be introduced for the area to be temporarily excluded.</p> 
 <br>
  <h2>Recent History</h2>
  <p>Ireland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955, after having been denied membership because of its neutral stance during the Second World War and not supporting the Allied cause.<br>
  At the time, joining the UN involved a commitment to using force to deter aggression by one state against another if the UN thought it was necessary.<br>
Interest towards membership of the European Communities (EC) developed in Ireland during the 1950s, with consideration also given to membership of the European Free Trade Area.<br>
 As the United Kingdom intended on EC membership, Ireland applied for membership in July 1961 due to the substantial economic linkages with the United Kingdom.<br>
 The founding EC members remained sceptical regarding Ireland's economic capacity, neutrality, and unattractive protectionist policy.<br>
 Many Irish economists and politicians realised that economic policy reform was necessary.<br>
 The prospect of EC membership became doubtful in 1963 when French President General Charles de Gaulle stated that France opposed Britain's accession, which ceased negotiations with all other candidate countries.<br>
 In 1969 his successor, Georges Pompidou, was not opposed to British and Irish membership. Negotiations began and in 1972 the Treaty of Accession was signed.<br>
 A referendum was held later that year which confirmed Ireland's entry into the bloc, and it finally joined the EC as a member state on 1 January 1973.<br>
The economic crisis of the late 1970s was fuelled by the Fianna Fáil government's budget, the abolition of the car tax, excessive borrowing, and global economic instability including the 1979 oil crisis.<br>
 There were significant policy changes from 1989 onwards, with economic reform, tax cuts, welfare reform, an increase in competition, and a ban on borrowing to fund current spending.<br>
 This policy began in 1989–1992 by the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats government, and continued by the subsequent Fianna Fáil/Labour government and Fine Gael/Labour/Democratic Left government.<br>
 Ireland became one of the world's fastest growing economies by the late 1990s in what was known as the Celtic Tiger period, which lasted until the Great Recession.<br>
 Since 2014, Ireland has experienced increased economic activity.<br>
In the Northern Ireland question, the British and Irish governments started to seek a peaceful resolution to the violent conflict involving many paramilitaries and the British Army in Northern Ireland known as "The Troubles".<br>
 A peace settlement for Northern Ireland, known as the Good Friday Agreement, was approved in 1998 in referendums north and south of the border.<br>
 As part of the peace settlement, the territorial claim to Northern Ireland in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland was removed by referendum.<br>
 In its white paper on Brexit the United Kingdom government reiterated its commitment to the Good Friday Agreement.<br>
 With regard to Northern Ireland's status, it said that the UK Government's "clearly-stated preference is to retain Northern Ireland's current constitutional position: as part of the UK, but with strong links to Ireland".</p>
